Inclusion criteria for the main releases (beta versions have all languages).

Rationale:
It is frustrating and look unprofessional for users to select their language only to realize that many parts are not actually translated. 
The following is the heuristic to enable the selection of languages to minimize this problem.

Heuristic:
1. Any language more than 85% translated in total is included.
2. Any language that has the Root component less than 75% translated is not included.
3. For the remaining languages, we look at the top level menus (mainly: File, View and Image) and the user interface of the player.
If there are too many untranslated strings directly visible in the menu and the player we do not include the language.
